            <p>The 'back end' of a website is a combination of technology and programming that powers a website. It consists of three parts that a user never sees: a server, an application, and a database.</p>
            <p>A back-end developer is someone who builds and maintains the technology needed to power the components which enable the user-facing side of the website to exist. Their back end code adds utility to everything the front-end developer creates.</p>

                CSS code - the core elements of front-end development. This includes design/layout, content, buttons, images, navigation, and internal links.</p>
